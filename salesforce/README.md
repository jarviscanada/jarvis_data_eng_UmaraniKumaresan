 ## Introduction
The scope of the Bear Tracking App project is to build an interactive application on the Salesforce platform that allows users to view, manage, and update bear profiles located in Ursus Park. This app is designed to demonstrate the power of Salesforce's declarative tools and programmatic capabilities, providing real-time visibility into tracked bear data. It supports component-based development using Lightning Web Components (LWC) and ensures seamless data interaction through Apex and Lightning Data Service.

This application is intended for Salesforce developers and administrators who aim to understand how to build scalable and user-centric solutions within the Salesforce ecosystem. The app can be extended or customized to fit similar wildlife tracking or CRM-related use cases.

The technologies and tools used in this project include Salesforce Platform, Apex, Lightning Web Components (LWC), Visualforce, Lightning App Builder, and Trailhead for learning and deployment.
