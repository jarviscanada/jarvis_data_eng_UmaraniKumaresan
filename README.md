**Salesforce** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_UmaraniKumaresan/tree/masterhttps://www.salesforce.com/trailblazer/n81yihads114d7d956)]: Utilized Salesforce Lightning Web Components (LWC) and Lightning Data Service to develop reusable components for a bear-tracking application in Ursus Park. Leveraged Salesforce App Builder to design and organize the application page layout efficiently. Built interactive child components that enabled users to view and edit bear profiles directly within the app. Integrated Apex methods for retrieving and updating bear data dynamically. Ensured component reusability and maintainability through modular design and separation of concerns. Conducted end-to-end testing and used Salesforce Debug Logs to troubleshoot and optimize performance.

**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_UmaraniKumaresan/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Cluster Monitor Agent that allows users to monitor and store hardware specifications and usage data for multiple Linux systems using bash scripts. The monitoring agent, when installed on each node, automatically collects hardware information and resource usage data from the server and persists it to the PostgreSQL database provisioned using Docker. Implemented Git for version control and used GitHub as the central repository, enabling effective code review and collaboration among team members.

**RDBMS and SQL** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_UmaraniKumaresan/tree/master/sql)]: Gained expertise in developing and managing relational databases using PostgreSQL. Proficient in performing CRUD operations, data modeling and applying normalization and denormalization principles. Designed advanced SQL queries for data manipulation and extraction, utilizing techniques such as joins, subqueries, and aggregations to manage data relationships and conduct in-depth analysis. Acquired a solid understanding of key database concepts, including entity relationships, primary and foreign keys, and normalization forms.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_UmaraniKumaresan/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Grep App: Developed a Java-based grep application for text pattern searching in files. Initially built with basic functionality, it was later optimized using Lambda and Stream APIs for improved performance and memory efficiency. The application handles large files effectively and was containerized using Docker for consistent deployment across environments, showcasing expertise in Java, modern APIs, and containerization.
  - StockQuote App: This Application is a Personal Stock Wallet that allows users to effortlessly buy, sell, and track all their stocks in one place. This acts as a central repository for all the company stocks utilizing PostgreSQL via JDBC. This app is portable across all platforms.

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_UmaraniKumaresan/tree/master/python_data_analytics)]: Developed a data analytics pipeline for a UK-based online giftware retailer to analyze transactional data using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Extracted insights on sales trends, customer behavior, and marketing optimization through data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Identified revenue fluctuations, customer retention patterns, and seasonal sales trends. Conducted RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers into categories such as "Loyal Customers" and "At Risk," enhancing targeted marketing strategies. Ensured data integrity, accurate visualizations, and modular code, delivering a reproducible and scalable analysis documented in Jupyter Notebook and deployed via GitHub.

**Spark** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_UmaraniKumaresan/tree/master/spark)]: Conducted data analysis on the World Development Indicators (WDI) and retail datasets using Zeppelin notebooks on GCP Dataproc and Azure Databricks. Utilized PySpark to process large-scale distributed data efficiently. Extracted key economic indicators such as country-wise GDP from the WDI dataset, and derived actionable business insights from the retail dataset, including total revenue, sales trends, and new monthly user metrics to support strategic growth decisions.
