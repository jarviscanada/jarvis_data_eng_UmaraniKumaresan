The monitoring agent, when installed on each node, automatically collects hardware information and resource usage data from the server and persists it to the PostgreSQL database provisioned using Docker. Periodically, resource usage is obtained using Crontab, and then the collected data can be manipulated using SQL queries. Implemented Git for version control and used GitHub as the central repository, enabling effective code review and collaboration among team members.",
